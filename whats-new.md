# What’s New

## Version 1.0.0 — Welcome to Chatura

**Chatura: Where Cura Meets Chat.**

Welcome to Chatura — a companion app featuring AI-generated characters designed for warm, everyday conversation.

Whether you want to celebrate a small win, untangle a thought, or simply feel a little steadier, you can open the app and start talking—no setup, no forms.

### What’s inside in 1.0.0
- **A warm core companion, ready anytime**: text-first chat for gentle check-ins and everyday grounding.
- **A cast of characters (6 total)**: explore different tones and perspectives (subscription unlocks 5 more).
- **Moments**: characters share small slices of daily life and thoughts—**like**, **comment**, or jump straight into chat.
- **Keepsakes you can revisit** (created through conversation):
  - **Our Memory**: highlights from your chats, automatically captured (and you can also ask to create one).
  - **Our Plan**: talk it through and turn it into a simple written plan.
  - **Time Capsule**: leave something for your future self.
  - **Wish Voice**: name a wish so it feels real and return to it later.
  - **Secret Haven**: a dedicated space for what’s hardest to say.
- **Secret Haven protection**: optional iOS App Lock + **locally encrypted storage** (for Secret Haven).
- **Privacy and control**: no ads. You can **delete conversations** anytime and **export your chat data** whenever you want.

### A few good first messages
Try one of these:
- “I’m feeling a bit off—can you help me name what’s going on?”
- “Let’s make a simple plan for my week.”
- “Help me draft a calm message I’m nervous to send.”
- “I want to write a Time Capsule for a future date.”
- “I have something private—can we put it in Secret Haven?”

Thank you for trusting Chatura on day one. We’ll keep making it warmer and more reliable with every update.
