# What’s New

## Version 1.0.0 — Welcome to Chatura

Welcome to Chatura — an AI companion app built for gentle, everyday conversation.

Whether you want to celebrate a small win, untangle a thought, or simply feel less alone, your character is here to listen and respond with care.

### In this first release
- **A core companion for everyday life** (plus five additional characters to explore)
- **Chat that feels human**: supportive check-ins, thoughtful questions, and practical help when you need it
- **Character profiles**: learn who they are through **Info** and **Interests**
- **Moments**: small slices of daily life shared with you
- **Status**: frequent updates that make your character feel present throughout the day
- **Memory**: highlights from your conversations, automatically captured—so what matters doesn’t get lost

### A good first message
Try: “How are you today?” or “Can we make a plan for my week?”

Thank you for trusting Chatura on day one. We’ll keep making it warmer, smarter, and more personal with every update.
