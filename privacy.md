# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-01-05  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-05

Chatura (“we”, “us”) is designed with privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy explains what we do and do not do with data when you use the Chatura iOS app (the “App”).

## 1. Summary

- No account is required.
- We do not run advertising SDKs.
- We do not use cross-app tracking for advertising.
- Your chat history is stored locally on your device.
- When you send a message, the App transmits your message to a third-party language model provider (currently OpenAI) to generate a reply.

## 2. Data we process to provide the chat experience

When you send a message in Chat, the App sends:
- The text you submit (and any necessary conversation context selected by the App) to generate a response.

We do this **only to generate the AI reply in real time**.

### Third-party processing (OpenAI)
We use OpenAI’s API to generate responses. OpenAI may process the content you send and certain network metadata (such as IP address) as part of providing the service. Please review OpenAI’s privacy documentation for details about their processing and retention practices.

## 3. What we do not collect

We do not require you to create an account and we do not ask for:
- Your name, email, phone number (unless you contact support)
- Contacts, photos, location, or device identifiers for advertising
- Advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA) for targeted ads
- Cross-app tracking for advertising purposes

We do not sell personal data.

## 4. What is stored on your device

The following may be stored locally on your device:
- Chat history
- App preferences and settings (e.g., theme)
- Character content you view or create
- Memory items generated within the App experience

## 5. Data retention

- **On our servers:** We do not store your chat messages on our own servers for product analytics or advertising.
- **Third-party provider:** OpenAI’s retention and use policies may apply to data processed via their API.

## 6. Your choices and controls

- You can delete your chat history within the App at any time.
- You can restrict the App’s network access in iOS settings, which will prevent AI replies from being generated via the API.

## 7. Children’s privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data to us, contact us and we will address the issue as appropriate.

## 8. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect product changes, legal requirements, or improvements. We will update the “Last updated” date above.
