<p><strong>Chatura: Where Cura Meets Chat.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A warm companion you’ll actually come back to.</strong><br />
Chatura is a character-led AI companion where gentle daily chats feel continuous—not disposable—and meaningful moments can become keepsakes you can revisit.</p>

<p><a href="#download">Download on the App Store</a></p>

<p><strong>No ads.</strong> · <strong>Delete conversations anytime.</strong> · <strong>Export your chat data.</strong><br />
<em>Chatura features AI-generated characters (not real people).</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-users-stay">Why Users Stay</h2>
<h3 id="a-steady-place-to-landwarmth-now-continuity-over-time">A steady place to land—warmth now, continuity over time.</h3>
<p>Some days you want a quick check-in. Some nights you need to talk it out. Chatura is designed for supportive, text-first companionship that meets you where you are—and leaves behind gentle touchpoints you can return to.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-warm-companionship-that-meets-you-where-you-are">1) Warm companionship that meets you where you are</h2>
<h3 id="kind-steady-conversationwithout-pressure-or-judgment">Kind, steady conversation—without pressure or judgment.</h3>
<p>Whether it’s a morning reset, a quiet moment between meetings, or late-night thoughts you don’t want to carry alone, Chatura responds with calm support and a familiar tone—so you can feel seen and a little lighter.</p>

<p><strong>Built for daily check-ins:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Text-first chat designed for calm, supportive companionship</li>
  <li>A dedicated core character optimized for everyday warmth</li>
  <li>Open the app and start talking—no setup, no forms</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-natural-interaction-just-talk-and-chatura-carries-the-load">2) Natural interaction: just talk, and Chatura carries the load</h2>
<h3 id="conversation-is-the-interface-chatura-does-the-organizing">Conversation is the interface. Chatura does the organizing.</h3>
<p>You don’t need workflows, templates, or “productivity rules.” As you chat, Chatura can shape what matters into lightweight keepsakes—so the conversation leaves something useful behind, without turning your life into a task system.</p>

<h3 id="keepsakes-you-can-return-to">Keepsakes you can return to</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Our Memory</strong> — small moments worth keeping</li>
  <li><strong>Our Plan</strong> — a clear next step you can revisit</li>
  <li><strong>Time Capsule</strong> — a message for your future self</li>
  <li><strong>Wish Voice</strong> — hopes you want to name out loud</li>
  <li><strong>Secret Haven</strong> — a dedicated place for what’s hard to say anywhere else</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keepsakes are created through chat as short texts/cards—simple to revisit, no complex setup.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-lifelike-characters-with-a-consistent-inner-world">3) Lifelike characters with a consistent inner world</h2>
<h3 id="not-one-generic-assistantsix-distinct-characters">Not one generic assistant—six distinct characters.</h3>
<p>Chatura is built around characters with their own tone, values, and way of seeing the world. Over time, each character stays true to who they are—so the connection feels stable, not random.</p>

<p><strong>What makes it feel grounded:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>6 characters total (<strong>1 core character by default; 5 more with subscription</strong>)</li>
  <li>Each character is anchored by <strong>Info / Status / Interests</strong></li>
  <li>Continuity comes from identity + shared touchpoints—not “perfect memory” claims</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-moments-that-keep-the-relationship-present-between-chats">4) Moments that keep the relationship present between chats</h2>
<h3 id="a-gentle-presenceeven-when-youre-not-talking">A gentle presence—even when you’re not talking.</h3>
<p>Chatura includes <strong>Moments</strong>: a calm feed where characters share small glimpses of daily life and thoughts. You can like, comment, and naturally step back into conversation—so companionship feels ongoing, not only reactive.</p>

<p><strong>Designed to feel ambient and low-effort:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Characters share Moments generated from their profiles</li>
  <li>Lightweight interaction: like, comment, jump into chat</li>
  <li>Built to sustain presence between conversations</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-safety-privacy-and-controlwithout-ads">5) Safety, privacy, and control—without ads</h2>
<h3 id="built-to-feel-safenot-extractive">Built to feel safe—not extractive.</h3>
<p>Chatura is designed around respect and user control. There are no ads and no data sharing for advertising or analytics. You can delete conversations anytime and export your chat data whenever you want.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy &amp; control:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No ads</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Delete conversations</strong> anytime</li>
  <li><strong>Export chat data</strong> across characters</li>
  <li><strong>Secret Haven</strong> can be protected with optional <strong>App Lock</strong>, with <strong>local encrypted storage</strong> for that content</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clear boundaries:</strong><br />
Chatura is for everyday supportive conversation and reflection. It does not provide medical advice or replace professional care.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<h3 id="how-chatura-fits-into-your-day">How Chatura fits into your day</h3>
<p><strong>1 — Talk</strong><br />
Open Chatura and message the core character anytime you want a steady check-in.</p>

<p><strong>2 — Keep what matters</strong><br />
When something feels important, Chatura can capture it into a Memory, Plan, Wish, or Time Capsule—right from the chat.</p>

<p><strong>3 — Come back to continuity</strong><br />
Revisit your keepsakes and Moments to feel a relationship thread that stays present over time.</p>
