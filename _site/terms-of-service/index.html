        <h1 id="chatura-terms-of-service">Chatura Terms of Service</h1>
<p>These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your use of the Chatura iOS application and related services (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

<p>“Chatura,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the operator of the Service.</p>

<p>The following document is incorporated by reference into these Terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-eligibility">1) Eligibility</h2>

<p>The Service is <strong>not intended for individuals under 18</strong>. By using the Service, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.</p>

<p>You may not use the Service if you are located in a country or region subject to U.S. government embargo, or if you are listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-the-service">2) The Service</h2>

<p>Chatura provides AI character chat and may offer additional AI-generated features over time (“<strong>AI generation</strong>”).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No account required.</strong> You can use the Service without registering.</li>
  <li><strong>On-device storage.</strong> Your chats and preferences are stored locally on your device. The Service does not provide cloud sync.</li>
  <li><strong>AI generation requires transmission.</strong> When you request AI-generated outputs, the Service transmits the necessary input to our backend so it can be sent to third-party AI/generation service providers to generate the output. For chat replies, this may include <strong>your latest message and the character’s full conversation history up to that point</strong>. <strong>Full conversation history may be transmitted for continuity.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue all or part of the Service at any time, including for maintenance, updates, or operational reasons.</p>

<p>For details on data handling and retention, please review our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We do not use your content or technical diagnostics for advertising or cross-app tracking.</p>

<p>You can withdraw consent for AI generation processing/transmission by not using AI generation features. For information on deleting on-device data and requesting deletion of any retained backend metadata logs (if any), see the Privacy Policy.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-subscriptions-and-purchases">3) Subscriptions and purchases</h2>

<p>Some features of the Service may require a paid subscription or other in-app purchase.</p>

<h3 id="a-purchases-through-apple">A) Purchases through Apple</h3>

<p>If you purchase a subscription or other in-app purchase through Apple’s in-app purchase system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Billing.</strong> Apple will charge your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-renewal (if applicable).</strong> If the subscription you purchase is an auto-renewing subscription, it will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Apple will charge your account for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
  <li><strong>Managing and cancelling.</strong> You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your device settings (for example, Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions). Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.</li>
  <li><strong>Trials and promotional offers (if offered).</strong> If a free trial or promotional pricing is offered, it will convert to a paid subscription at the end of the trial or promotion unless you cancel before it ends. If you purchase a subscription, any unused portion of a free trial (if offered) will be forfeited.</li>
  <li><strong>Price and terms shown at purchase.</strong> Subscription pricing, billing period, and any applicable trial or promotional terms will be shown to you before you complete the purchase.</li>
  <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> Apple, not Chatura, processes payments and generally controls refunds and chargebacks. We cannot process refunds directly. To request a refund, please follow Apple’s refund process.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="b-changes-and-availability">B) Changes and availability</h3>

<p>We may change subscription offerings, features, or availability over time, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-important-disclaimers-about-ai-content">4) Important disclaimers about AI content</h2>

<h3 id="a-no-professional-advice">A) No professional advice</h3>

<p>The Service is provided for general informational and companionship purposes. <strong>AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or inappropriate</strong>, and should not be relied upon as professional advice.</p>

<p>Chatura is <strong>not</strong> a medical or healthcare service and is <strong>not</strong> intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any condition. Do not use the Service as a substitute for professional care.</p>

<h3 id="b-not-for-emergencies">B) Not for emergencies</h3>

<p>The Service is <strong>not</strong> designed for emergency use. If you believe you may be in immediate danger or need urgent help, contact local emergency services.</p>

<h3 id="c-content-similarity">C) Content similarity</h3>

<p>AI systems may produce outputs that are similar or identical for different users. You understand that outputs may not be unique and that similar outputs may be provided to others.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-your-content-and-permissions">5) Your content and permissions</h2>

<h3 id="a-your-content">A) Your content</h3>

<p>“<strong>Your Content</strong>” means the text and other content you submit to the Service (for example, messages you send). You are responsible for Your Content.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have all rights necessary to provide Your Content; and</li>
  <li>Your Content and your use of the Service will not violate any law or infringe any third-party rights.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="b-permission-to-process-your-content">B) Permission to process Your Content</h3>

<p>You retain any rights you may have in Your Content. However, to operate the Service and provide AI generation you request, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to <strong>transmit, process, and display</strong> Your Content solely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide the Service to you (including sending Your Content to third-party AI/generation service providers to generate outputs);</li>
  <li>maintain and secure the Service; and</li>
  <li>comply with applicable law.</li>
</ul>

<p>This license is limited to operating the Service and does not transfer ownership of Your Content.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="6-intellectual-property">6) Intellectual property</h2>

<p>The Service, including its software, design, and branding, is owned by us and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. Except as expressly permitted by these Terms, you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, reverse engineer, or create derivative works of any part of the Service.</p>

<p>Chatura may present fictional characters and generated content. Any names, likenesses, or depictions are for entertainment and companionship purposes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="7-acceptable-use">7) Acceptable use</h2>

<p>You agree not to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the Service in a way that violates any law or regulation;</li>

  <li>use the Service to misrepresent AI-generated content as human-generated when that representation would be deceptive or unlawful.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="8-third-party-services">8) Third-party services</h2>

<p>We do not control third-party services and are not responsible for their acts or omissions. Your use of third-party services may be subject to their terms and policies.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="9-termination">9) Termination</h2>

<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or if we discontinue the Service.</p>

<p>Because the Service does not require accounts, termination may mean that the Service becomes unavailable to you, and you may lose access to locally stored app features. You can remove local app data by uninstalling the app, which generally removes app-stored local data from the device.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="10-disclaimers">10) Disclaimers</h2>

<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICE.</p>

<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) TO USE THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>

  <li>Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the Service;</li>
  <li>in the event of any failure of the Service to conform to any applicable warranty (if any), you may notify Apple and Apple may refund the purchase price (if any) for the Service, and Apple will have no other warranty obligation with respect to the Service; and</li>
