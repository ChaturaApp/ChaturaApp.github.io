# Chatura Privacy Policy
Chatura ("**Chatura**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**") is an iOS app that provides AI character chat for warm, supportive companionship. This Privacy Policy explains what information is stored on your device, what information may be transmitted to generate AI outputs, and what limited technical metadata our servers may record for reliability.

---

## 1) Privacy highlights

- **No account required.** You can use Chatura without registering.
- **Privacy-minimal by design.** We do not ask for account identifiers like your name, email address, or phone number.
- **No ads and no cross-app tracking.** We do not serve ads and we do not track you across apps or websites.
- **No third-party analytics SDKs.** We do not integrate third-party analytics SDKs (for example, Firebase, Amplitude, Adjust).
- **On-device storage (no cloud sync).** Your chats and preferences are stored locally on your iPhone/iPad. Chatura does not provide cloud sync.
- **AI generation requires sending context.** When you request AI-generated outputs, Chatura transmits the necessary input to our backend so it can be sent to third-party AI/generation service providers. For chat replies, this includes **your latest message and the character’s full conversation history up to that point**. **Full conversation history may be transmitted for continuity.**

---

## 2) Information stored on your device

Chatura stores the following **only on your device**:

- **Chat messages and character conversation history** (your messages and AI character replies)
- **User preferences** related to the in-app experience

Chatura does **not** provide cloud sync. If you switch devices, your local data does not automatically transfer through Chatura.

Your device backup settings (for example, iCloud backup) may include app data depending on your iOS settings. Chatura itself does not provide a separate cloud sync feature.

---

## 3) What leaves your device (and why)

To generate AI content, certain information must be transmitted off-device.

### A) AI generation (chat replies and other generated outputs)

When you request AI generation, Chatura sends your request to our backend forwarding layer (operated using a cloud infrastructure provider). That backend forwards the request to third-party AI/generation services (for example, an AI gateway and/or one or more underlying model providers) to generate the output.

Depending on the feature, the transmitted content may include:

- **your latest message**
- **the character’s full conversation history up to that point** (for continuity)
- **your generation request content** (for example, prompts or instructions you provide)
- **any content you include as part of a generation request** (for example, text you submit for processing)

We use this transmitted context only to generate the output you requested and to support continuity. For chat replies, **full conversation history may be transmitted** when you request a response.

### B) Technical metadata for reliability and diagnostics

Our backend may record limited **metadata logs** for reliability and troubleshooting, such as:

- timestamps
- status codes
- latency/performance timing
- request size / token count (or similar request volume measures)

**We do not log the text content of your chats or prompts** in our backend logs.

**Retention:** We keep these metadata logs only when needed to investigate reliability issues and, if retained, for **no more than 3 days**.

**Standard network data:** When requests reach our backend and third-party providers, standard connection information (for example, IP address and user-agent) may be processed by the relevant infrastructure and AI/generation providers for security, abuse prevention, and reliability. We do not use this information to identify you or for tracking.

---

## 4) Service providers

Chatura relies on third-party service providers to operate the app and deliver AI features.

**Providers may change over time.** We aim to keep this policy accurate about *what categories of providers we use* and *what data may be processed*. If you would like the current list of providers and links to their policies, please contact us using the details in the Contact section.

### A) Cloud infrastructure provider

We use a cloud infrastructure provider to run our backend services (for example, request forwarding and operational reliability).

### B) AI and generation service providers

To generate outputs (for example, chat replies and, if available, other generated content), we use third-party AI/generation services (for example, an AI gateway and/or one or more underlying model providers). These providers receive the content we transmit for generation (including, for continuity, the character’s full conversation history up to that point for chat replies).

### C) Logging platform (metadata only)

For operational reliability, **metadata logs** (for example, timestamps, status codes, latency, request size/token counts) may be forwarded to **a logging platform**.

We do not send chat content to this logging destination.

If metadata logs are forwarded to a logging platform, they are forwarded only when needed for reliability investigations and are retained for **no more than 3 days**.

---

## 5) How we use information

We use information to (a) provide core functionality (store chats and preferences on-device and generate the AI outputs you request), (b) support continuity by transmitting necessary context for generation (including, for chat replies, the character’s full conversation history up to that point), and (c) maintain reliability and troubleshoot using limited metadata logs.

We do not use your information for advertising or marketing, and we do not track you across apps or websites.

---

## 6) Data retention

### A) On your device

- Your chat history and preferences remain on-device unless you remove them.
- You can remove local data by using any available in-app deletion options (if provided) and/or uninstalling the app, which generally removes app-stored local data from the device.

### B) Our backend systems

- We do **not** store your chat content on our backend.
- We may retain only the limited **metadata logs** described in Section 3(B). These logs do not include your chat text.
- **Metadata log retention:** We keep metadata logs only when needed to investigate reliability issues and, if retained, for **no more than 3 days**.
- **Network request logs:** Standard connection metadata (for example, IP address and user-agent) may be processed as part of operating the Service (security and reliability). We do not use it for tracking. To the extent such data is retained in our backend logs for reliability investigations, it follows the same **no more than 3 days** retention window.

### C) Third parties

Third-party services (for example, AI/generation service providers) may process content transmitted to generate outputs. Their retention practices are governed by their own policies, which we cannot control. If you would like the current list of third-party providers used by Chatura and links to their policies, please contact us using the details in the Contact section.

### D) Withdrawing consent and requesting deletion

**A) Delete on-device data.** Your chats and preferences are stored locally on your device. You can remove local data by using any available in-app deletion options (if provided) and/or uninstalling the app, which generally removes app-stored local data from the device.

**B) Withdraw consent for AI processing/transmission.** If you do not want your messages and conversation context to be transmitted off-device for AI generation, do not use AI generation features. Because AI generation requires sending context to our backend and third-party AI/generation providers, withdrawing consent for this processing means stopping use of those AI generation features.

**C) Request deletion of backend metadata logs (if any).** We do not store chat content on our backend. If you would like to request deletion of any retained metadata logs (as described in Section 3(B)), contact us at **chaturaapp@gmail.com** with (i) the approximate time window of the issue and (ii) any relevant details that help us locate the applicable logs. We will delete applicable retained logs to the extent we are able to identify them.

**D) Third-party providers.** Third-party AI/generation providers may process content transmitted to generate outputs under their own policies. We do not control their retention or deletion practices. You may contact us to obtain the current list of providers and links to their policies so you can review their options and submit any deletion request to the provider(s) directly.

Chatura is **not intended for individuals under 18**, and we do not knowingly collect information from individuals under 18.
